On Windows? Want to compile native Node modules? Install the build tools with this one-liner:

```
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

After installation, npm will automatically execute this module, which downloads and installs Visual
C++ Build Tools, provided free of charge by Microsoft. These tools are [required to compile popular native modules](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp).
It will also install Python 2.7, configuring your machine and npm appropriately.

> :bulb: [Windows Vista / 7 only] requires [.NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773) (Currently not installed automatically by this package)

Both installations are conflict-free, meaning that they do not mess with existing installations of
Visual Studio, C++ Build Tools, or Python. If you see anything that indiciates otherwise, please
file a bug.

## Visual Studio 2017 vs Visual Studio 2015
This module is capable of installing either the build tools from Visual Studio [2017](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/11/16/introducing-the-visual-studio-build-tools/) or Visual
Studio [2015](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/03/31/announcing-the-official-release-of-the-visual-c-build-tools-2015/). Since Node's underlying build tools still don't fully support 2017, you might
have a better experience with 2015 - even if it sounds a bit outdated. On the other hand, if
you are only trying to compile a certain set of modules, the 2017 build tools are smaller and
install a bit quicker.

By default, this tool will install the 2015 build tools. To change that, run this script with
the `--vs2017` parameter.

## Usage

```
npm [--add-python-to-path] [--python-mirror=''] [--proxy=''] [--debug] [--strict-ssl] [--resume] [--sockets=5] [--vcc-build-tools-parameters=''] [--vs2017] install --global windows-build-tools
```

Optional arguments:

* `--add-python-to-path`: Add Python to the environment, allowing you to type `python.exe` in any shell. Defaults to `false`.
* `--python-mirror`: Use a given mirror to download Python (like `--python_mirror=https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/python/`). You can alternatively set a `PYTHON_MIRROR` environment variable.
* `--proxy`: Use a given proxy. You can alternatively set a `PROXY` environment variable.
* `--debug`: Be extra verbose in the logger output. Equal to setting the environment variable `DEBUG` to `*`.
* `--strict-ssl`: Enables "Strict SSL" mode. Defaults to false.
* `--resume`: By default, `windows-build-tools` will resume aborted downloads. Set to `false` to disable.
* `--sockets`: Specifies the number of http sockets to use at once (this controls concurrency). Defaults to infinity.
* `--vcc-build-tools-parameters`: Specifies additional parameters for the Visual C++ Build Tools 2015. See below for more detailed usage instructions.
* `--silent`: The script will not output any information.
* `--vs2017`: Install the Visual Studio 2017 Build Tools instead of the Visual Studio 2015 ones.

## Supplying Parameters to the VCC Build Tools

You can pass additional parameters directly to the VCC Build Tools installer. This tool does not
check if the parameters make sense - passing incorrect parameters might break the whole
installation.

Supply parameters to `windows-build-tools` as a JSON array. Here's quick example (note the double quotes):

```
npm --vcc-build-tools-parameters='[""--allWorkloads""]' install --global windows-build-tools
```

### Visual Studio 2015 Parameters

 - `/AdminFile`: <filename> Specifies the installation control file.
 - `/CreateAdminFile`: <filename> Specifies the location to create a control file that can then be used
 - `/CustomInstallPath`: <path> Set Custom install location.
 - `/ForceRestart`: Always restart the system after installation.
 - `/Full`: Install all product features.
 - `/InstallSelectableItems`: <item1;item2;...;itemN> Choose which selectable item(s) to be installed.
-selectable item to be installed, just pass in this switch without any value.
 - `/Layout`: Create a copy of the media in specified folder.
 - `/NoRefresh`: Prevent setup checking for updates from the internet.
 - `/NoRestart`: Do not restart during or after installation.
 - `/NoWeb`: Prevent setup downloading from the internet.
 - `/Passive`: Display progress but do not wait for user input.
 - `/ProductKey`: <25-character product key> Set custom product key (no dashes).
 - `/PromptRestart`: Prompt the user before restarting the system.
 - `/Repair`: Repair the product.
 - `/Uninstall`: Uninstall the product.
 - `/Uninstall /Force`: Uninstall the product and features shared with other products.

### Visual Studio 2017 Parameters

If you run `windows-build-tools` with `--vs2017`, the available parameters [are documented here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio).

## Support & Help

This package currently only handles the most common use case, none of the edge cases. If you encounter errors, we'd greatly appreciate [error reports](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) (and even pull requests). This is currently tested on Windows 10.

#### Where is Python installed?

It's saved under `%USERPROFILE%\.windows-build-tools\python27`.

#### 'Python' is not recognized as a command

To not mess with your machine in unnecessary ways, Python is only installed to disk and configured
with npm. If you'd like for the `python` command to work in `cmd.exe` and PowerShell, add the
folder `%USERPROFILE%\.windows-build-tools\python27` to your environment variables.

## License & Credits

The Python installation was made possible by [Ali Hajimirza](https://github.com/A92hm), who kindly wrestled with Python's MSIs until they surrendered.
